IN THE BEGGINING, EMOTION SET THE COGS IN MOTION.
RED WAS THE FIRST FORM, BUT NO RED WOULD EXIST WITHOUT BLUE, FROM BOTH OF THEM, PURPLE WAS APPARENT.
NOBILITY WAS CONCEPTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE WILDNESS OF GREEN, SO PURPLE AND GREEN FABRICATED SILVER.
SILVER REFLECTED, AND SILVER'S REFLECTION WAS SILVER, BANGING 2 INGOTS TOGETHER, PURITY WAS FOUND, WHITE.
WHITE PEERED TO WHAT WAS CONTRADICTORY TO IT'S NATURE, BLACK, BLACK AND WHITE MADE GRAY.
AND GRAY WAS JUST ANOTHER EXPRESSION OF SILVER, THUS, THIRD SILVER WAS BORN AND THE COUNCIL WAS FORMED.

THE COUNCIL SPOKE INTO EXISTENCE 90 ADDITIONAL UNIQUE VESSELS, EACH BEARING THEIR OWN ESSENCE, IN ORDER TO BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE LOOP OF WHITE, BLACK, GRAY AND SILVER.
